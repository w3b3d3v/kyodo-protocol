# Kyōdō Protocol 

The future of work is being transformed by the relationship between Professionals, Communities and Businesses. Kyōdō Protocol facilitates trusted connections between these professional parties with a decentralized, blockchain-driven solution. The protocol provides a payments system with verifiable credentials and proof of curriculum using Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) to enhance privacy. 

For more information about how Kyōdō functions, head to [Kyōdō Protocol docs](https://docs.kyodoprotocol.xyz/).

## 1 - Environment Setup
Make sure you have an `.env.development.local` file in your root directory. A template file named `.env.development.local.sample` is provided. Rename it to `.env.development.local`

To run tests or deploy contracts on the Mumbai test network, you'll need to set up the appropriate environment variables in the `.env` file in your root directory. A template file named `.env.sample` is provided. Rename it to `.env`

## 2 - Setting Up Local Blockchain
Run a Hardhat node:

```bash
cd contracts/ethereum
npx hardhat node --fork https://rpc.ankr.com/eth_goerli
```

The node will generate some accounts. Add the first one to Metamask.
> **_NOTE:_** Note: Use the first account to avoid errors.

## 3 - Deploying Smart Contracts
Deploy the Agreement contract and the fake Stablecoin:
```bash
cd contracts/ethereum
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

## 4 - Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

# 🌟 Interacting with Smart Contracts 🌟
You can interact with the smart contracts either through the frontend application or by running the following scripts:

### Via Scripts

Create an agreement:
```bash
cd contracts/ethereum
npx hardhat run scripts/createAgreements.js
```

Retrieve all agreements or the user (deployer) agreements:
```bash
cd contracts/ethereum
npx hardhat run scripts/retrieveAgreements.js
```

Pay for the agreement you've created:
```bash
cd contracts/ethereum
npx hardhat run scripts/payAgreement.js
```

### Via Frontend
To pay for the agreement through the user interface, you need to allow the contract first, as the logic to check allowance through the UI is not implemented yet:

```bash
cd contracts/ethereum
npx hardhat run scripts/allow.js
```
